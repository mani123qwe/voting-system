## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **HTML** – Structure of the voting system.  
- **CSS & Bootstrap** – Styling and responsiveness.  
- **JavaScript** – Handles voting logic, validation, and animations.

## 📌 How It Works
1. **User Enters Registration Number**  
   - Only predefined registration numbers (101–108) are accepted.  
   - Invalid or non-numeric IDs trigger an alert.  

2. **User Selects an IPL Team**  
   - Teams available for voting:
     - 🦁 CSK (Chennai Super Kings)  
     - 🌊 MI (Mumbai Indians)  
     - 🔥 RCB (Royal Challengers Bangalore)  
     - ⚡ KKR (Kolkata Knight Riders)  
     - 🏹 LSG (Lucknow Super Giants)  

3. **Vote Submission**  
   - If everything is correct, the vote is recorded, and the user gets a success message.  
   - If the user tries to vote again, an alert prevents duplicate voting.  

4. **Final Voting Results**  
   - Once all registered users have voted, a pop-up shows the total votes per team.

## 🎯 Future Enhancements

- **More Teams** – Add all IPL teams.  
- **Live Vote Dashboard** – Display real-time vote counts.
